## Flatiron School
[Flatiron School](https://flatironschool.com/) is a 15-week coding bootcamp, with courses in software engineering, data science, cybersecurity, and product design.

Upon completion of the course, students lose access to the internal class portal, called Canvas. Students are provided with html and javascript data files, containing information on the modules and courses used throughout the phases of the bootcamp.

## Flatiron Open Source
The challenge we [Hope](https://github.com/umuthopeyildirim), [Ian](https://github.com/igottheim/) set out of accomplish is how to make the data provided upon graduation user friendly for future review and preparation for interviews. This is what sparked the idea for Flatiron Open Source. The goal was to recreate the internal class portal for Flatiron graduates to use and collaborate. 

This blog will run through the process to create the front end, while future blogs will discuss back end and user implementation
