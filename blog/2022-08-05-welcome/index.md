How are you? I hope you are doing well and staying healthy. My name is [hope](https://umutyildirim.com/about). I am a software engineer and a full time student. 
I created this website to share my thoughts and new things I have learned. I hope you enjoy it.

So let me explain how I structured this website! I promise you I won't bore you with the details :D

These are the main sections of the website:
- [Main Page](/)
- [About Me](/about)
- [Projects](/projects)
- [Tutorials](/docs/intro)
- [Blogs](/blog)
- [Gists](/gists)
- [Contact](/contact)

So let's start with the [main page](/). 


## Main Page
It is the home page of the website. It contains some basic information about me and a list of my recent projects. If you click on the 'Get Started' button, you will be redirected to the tutorial page.

## Tutorials
NEXT! Let's go to the [tutorial page](/tutorial). It contains a list of tutorials I have written. You can click on the 'Get Started' button to go to the first tutorial.

After you finish reading all my tutorials, you can check out my projects. I'm sure you will find something you like ;)
