# CI/CD

Markhope uses Github Actions to build and deploy the site. This means your website will be automatically deployed to Github Pages when you push your changes to the main branch.

:::caution

Github Actions is free for public repositories. If you want to use Github Actions for private repositories, you need to pay for it.
