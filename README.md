This is my personal Wikipedia! It aims to document _everything_ I've learned and done in my life. I'm a software engineer, but I'm also interested in many other things. I'm a lifelong learner, and I'm always trying to learn new things. I'm also a big fan of sharing knowledge, so I'm trying to document everything I learn here.
I never expected this project to end up on such a consequential scale. This project started as a test flight on investigating how Docusaurus could handle "multiplex" data, which surprised me with its capability. Then I started adding a bunch of features from a post where I initially imagined what I would've done if I had created a Digital Brain. Now that it is stable and performant, I hereby open-source this project. I hope anyone around the üåê will gain from this.
